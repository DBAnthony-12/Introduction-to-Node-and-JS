Introduction to Node.js
---------------------------------------
Node.js is an open-source platform that uses JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js is a JavaScript engine developed by Google that makes it easier to create networked applications and allows for server-side scripting.  Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, microservices, and other backend services, leveraging its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available through the NPM (Node Package Manager). Frameworks like Express.js and libraries like Socket.io, it may use JavaScript on the client and server sides, which facilitates code reusability and speeds up full-stack development. 

JavaScript and Node:
--------------------------------------
Front-end features and components are widely used in current web development. JavaScript is a programming language that is used to build interactive and dynamic web applications. It is extensively supported by contemporary web browsers and enables programmers to utilize AJAX to interact with servers, handle user interactions, add activity to web pages, and modify DOM elements. JavaScript is also increasingly used for server-side development through platforms like Node.js.

Node.js is an open-source world-wide platform that uses JavaScript engine and serves as a foundation for the cross-platform. Node makes it possible for programmers to run on JavaScript code on the server side which facilitates the creation of scalable and effective applications. Node.js has an event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, it is effective and lightweight when managing concurrent connections and real-time applications. It is frequently used to create web servers, APIs, microservices, and other backend services by utilizing the extensive library and framework ecosystem that is made available by NPM (Node Package Manager).

Pros of JavaScript
----------------------------------
We may use the same language for the front end and the back end with Node.js, which makes code sharing easier between these parts possible.   An interesting distinction lies in JavaScript's dynamic nature; its type is determined by value, not during variable declaration, showcasing loose typing as opposed to strong typing.  JavaScript seamlessly integrates with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a format well-suited for web applications on both the front and back ends.

The pros of JavaScript:
-------------------------------
	Versatility
	Wide adoption
	Rich ecosystem
	Dynamic and interactive
	Cross-platform compatibility

Call Backs and Asynchronous Task
-----------------------------------
CallBacks: Callbacks are functions that are supplied as parameters to a different function that will run later, usually following the conclusion of an asynchronous action.  Callbacks are frequently used in conjunction with functions that carry out input/output tasks, such reading files, requesting resources from the network, or starting timers. Callbacks are useful for managing asynchronous code, but they can also result in nested callbacks which makes the code harder to comprehend and manage.

Asynchronous 
----------------------------------
behaviour allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the file reading operation to complete, improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. 

Synchronous 
-----------------------------------
is the execution of the program halts at the end of call until reading operation is complete.
